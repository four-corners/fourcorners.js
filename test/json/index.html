It was late January in the middle of the day when a phone call came from the Ministry of Health to notify that a meeting would be held regarding the emerging pandemic. One of the hospital's physicians leading the hospital’s triage unit was assigned to participate in the meeting, which she referred to as “the wake up call.\" Every hospital was told to prepare a screening area and form a task force which would be involved in managing the unfolding pandemic.
