      "fourcorners:backstoryText": "It was about 4 a.m. and roughly 20 minutes after the first shooting. When the first shooting occurred I was two blocks away and people scattered. Police barricades were stampeded. When the second shooting occurred I was on the corner of Franklin and Empire, half a block away. The gunshot was a light pop and sounded almost like a firecracker. A few people ran but initially people seemed unsure whether it was a gunshot or not, myself included. Then I saw police rushing to the scene. Only when I got a bit closer did I see Ms. Poyau on the ground."
