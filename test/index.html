She risked dismissal from service for revealing her identity. Maya said, \"I’ve gone to work scared every day that today is going to be the day that they are going to hammer down on me...for just being me.” Being openly transgender in the military is found as a behavioral or mental disorder and they can kick you out.\" On July 14th 2015, U.S Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced the beginning of a six-month review that would allow transgender men and women to serve openly in the U.S. Military. The Trump administration has since reversed the progress and the United States Government will no longer accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military."},"imagery":{"media":[{"source":"image","url":"https://fourcornersproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Laub_Trans_Web-4_THUMBNAIL_2.jpg","caption":"Specialist Maya Martinez off duty, Savannah, Georgia, 2014","credit":"Gillian Laub","index":0},{"source":"vimeo","url":"https://vimeo.com/143768876","caption":"TIME: Camouflaged Identity","credit":"Gillian Laub and Shaul Schwarz","index":1}]},"links":{"links":[{"source":"link","url":"http://time.com/camouflaged-identity/","title":"Camouflaged Identity: Transgender Military Soliders","index":0},{"source":"link","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transgender-military-ban-trump-administration-ban-on-transgender-troops-goes-into-effect/","title":"Controversial Trump Administration Ban on Transgender Troops Goes into Effect","index":1},{"source":"link","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/05/trump-military-transgender-ban-cruel-pride-month-column/1338664001/","title":"Trump's transgender ban is cruel, medically unethical and damaging to the US military","index":2}]},"opts":{"dark":false},"photo":{},"lang":"en"}</script><img class="fc-img" src="https://fourcornersproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Laub_Trans_Web-4_THUMBNAILcopy.jpg"/></div>
