I am also not allowed to lie about what I was there for. But in this case, it is a little bit different because the story is about a couple fabricating a story and hiding the truth from the family. As a journalist, I shouldn’t interfere with the story by revealing the truth to the family. So after internal editorial discussion, we decided that when I approach the family, I should tell them the partial truth, which is “I am here to photograph the couple going back to Wang Quanming’s home for Spring Festival.”"},"imagery":{"media":[{"source":"image","url":"https://www.exhibit.fourcornersproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/clean_room.jpg","caption":"Nong Xiurong, Wang Quanming's mother, cleaned a very messy storage room so that Zhao Yuqing doesn’t have a bad impression of the family.","credit":"REUTERS/Muyi Xiao","index":0}]},"links":{"links":[{"source":"link","url":"https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/hopes-and-expectations-the-journey-of-a-fake-girlfriend","title":"Hopes and expectations: the journey of a fake girlfriend","index":0}]},"opts":{"caption":true,"credit":true,"logo":true},"photo":{},"lang":"en"}</script><img src="./json/muyi-xiao.jpeg"></div>
